        We the <input type="text"className="input-blank"placeholder="1."/> take no pride in our
        educational achievement with you. We have prepared you for a world that does not exist, indeed, that cannot
        exist. You have spent four years supposing that failure leaves no record. You have learned at Brown that when
        your work goes poorly, the painless solution is to drop out. But starting now, in the world to which you go,
        failure marks you.
        <input type="text"className="input-blank" placeholder="2." /> difficulty by quitting leaves
        you changed. Outside Brown, <input type="text"className="input-blank" placeholder="3." />
        are no heroes.
